# Advent of Code 2022, in Rust! 🦀

Except the [Rust lang book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) I done almost a year ago, this is my first lines in Rust, please be tolerant with my code!

Go to [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

Happy to hear any tips with an issue.

Merry Christmas! 🎅☃️
